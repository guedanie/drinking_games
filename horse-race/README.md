# Horse Race 

### Game Rules:
    The Horse Race drinking game is a very fun one, where players gamble on what suit of cards will essentially win a "horse race", where the Ace from each suit progresses by cards from their suit being randomly drawn by the "announcer".

### Traditional Game Set-up: 
    The setup for this drinking game will resemble a tall "L". First, find the four Aces and arrange them side by side on the short end of the "L" shape. Then, lay the next 8 cards off the top of the deck face-down along the tall side of the "L", starting the first row ABOVE the row of Aces. Finally, appoint someone the race "announcer", who will flip the cards throughout the game.
